# iLQR with Neural Network Dynamics Model on MountainCarContinuous-v0

This repository contains an implementation of an iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) using a learned neural network dynamics model, applied to the classic reinforcement learning environment `MountainCarContinuous-v0` from OpenAI Gym.

## 🚗 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore model-based control using iLQR, where the system dynamics are learned using a neural network.
## 🧠 Key Features

- iLQR/MPC type controller
- Simple 2 layered MLP for dynamics model
- Evaluation on OpenAI Gym's `MountainCarContinuous-v0` environment.
